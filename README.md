# CSharpDesignPatterns

## Summary

This is my interpretation of the 23 GoF (Gang of Four) design patterns, as described in the classic software engineering book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". 

I am developing this project using TDD (Test Driven Development). For each pattern I am creating a "Main{pattern}App" class purely to provide the reader an example usage/implementation of the pattern.

## Purpose
I believe that, when design patterns are implemented appropriately, are a very powerful tool. I am creating this repository to learn about the most common patterns in use in object oriented design.

Please note: the code in this repository is only intended for me (and anyone reading) to gain a better overview of the design patterns used. The examples are very simple abstractions of the patterns used; there are no real features or validation implemented :)
