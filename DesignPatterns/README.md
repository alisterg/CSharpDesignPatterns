# CSharpDesignPatterns

## Summary

This is my interpretation of the 23 GoF (Gang of Four) design patterns, as described in the classic software engineering book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software".

## Purpose
I believe that, when design patterns are implemented appropriately, are a very powerful tool. I am creating this repository to learn about the most common patterns in use in object oriented design.

Please note: the code in this repository is only intended for me (and anyone reading) to gain a better overview of the design patterns used. The examples are very simple abstractions of the patterns used.
